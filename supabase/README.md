# Supabase backup

Everything Property HQ needs from Supabase that is not data, captured from the
live project on 2026-10-13 so the database can be rebuilt anywhere.

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `schema.sql` | Full schema snapshot: 19 tables, constraints, indexes, functions, triggers, row-level security on every table (61 policies), the `property-files` storage bucket and its 4 policies. No data, no secrets. |
| `functions/*/index.ts` | Source of the 3 edge functions deployed in the project (`process-monthly-rent`, `create-stripe-payment`, `stripe-webhook`). |

Source project: `supabase-propertyhq`, ref `fxmlwozvjzzntorolhtv` (us-east-1).

`schema.sql` was generated from the Postgres catalog (`pg_catalog`,
`pg_policies`, `storage.buckets`, `cron.job`), so it describes what is actually
deployed. The older files in `scripts/` were partial, hand-run migrations and
did not include the base tables (properties, tenants, rent payments, messages,
expenses, and others). The live database's own migration history
(`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, 14 entries) also starts after those
base tables were created.

## Rebuilding on a new Supabase project

1. Create the project, then open **SQL Editor** and run `supabase/schema.sql`
   once, on the empty database.
2. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the site URL and redirect
   URLs for the Vercel deployment (see `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL` in the app).
3. In Vercel, point the app at the new project: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
4. Edge functions are optional (see Known issues). To deploy them, use the
   Supabase CLI (`supabase functions deploy <name>`) and set their secrets:
   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and for `stripe-webhook` also
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`. `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS`
   are provided by Supabase automatically.

Auth users, rows and uploaded files are data and are not part of this backup.

## Known issues found while exporting (not changed by this backup)

- **Edge functions are unused by the app.** Nothing in `app/`, `lib/` or
  `components/` calls them. Rent invoices come from the Vercel cron
  `/api/cron/generate-invoices` and Stripe goes through the Next.js routes
  (`app/api/stripe`, `app/actions/rent-checkout.ts`).
- **The `process-monthly-rent-day-1` pg_cron job cannot run.** It calls
  `net.http_post`, but the `pg_net` extension is not installed, and the vault
  secrets it reads (`project_url`, `edge_invoke_key`) do not exist. It is
  recorded in `schema.sql` but commented out.
- **`stripe-webhook` is deployed with JWT verification on.** Stripe does not
  send a Supabase JWT, so Supabase would reject Stripe's calls before the
  function runs. Moot while the function is unused.
- **Supabase security advisor warnings:**
  - `public.is_tenant_of` is `SECURITY DEFINER` and callable by `anon` and
    `authenticated` through `/rest/v1/rpc/is_tenant_of`. It only answers
    "is the signed-in user this tenant?", but `EXECUTE` should be revoked from
    `anon`.
  - `public.set_updated_at` has no fixed `search_path`.
  - Leaked-password protection (HaveIBeenPwned check) is off in Auth settings.
- **`public.todos`** is a leftover from the Supabase starter template and is
  not used by the app.
- **Nine tables have an `updated_at` column but no trigger maintaining it**:
  `expenses`, `file_folders`, `files`, `maintenance_requests`, `properties`,
  `property_owners`, `rent_payments`, `rent_schedules`, `tenants`. Their
  `updated_at` only changes when the app sets it explicitly.
